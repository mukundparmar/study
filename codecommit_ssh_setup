This process is easy but keeping all steps here.

1. Create the IAM user with AWS codeCommit Full access permission attached.
2. IAM > security > add ssh public key there.
3. Before #3 setup ssh pub/private key using ssh-keygen or use existing key.
4. Don't be confused with SSH Key ID and IAM Key ID they both are different during setting up ~/.ssh/config.
5. Setup the ~/.ssh/config file as below
```
Host git-codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
  User XXXXYYYYZZZ
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/moodmd
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
```
6. testing ssh git-codecommit.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com
